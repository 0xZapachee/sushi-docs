# Governance/Voting FAQ

### What are Multisigs and why do they matter?

The Multisigs are the ultimate decision-makers in the SushiSwap ecosystem. The Treasury Multisig wallet is composed of 6 prominent and trusted members of the DeFi/Ethereum ecosystem, and they must approve any use of the devfunds. A transaction requires at least 3 out of 6 signatures to pass and be executed.

The Ops Multisig is primarily composed of core team members and is the hurdle that needs to be passed for any changes to our smart contracts. Any transaction to be executed requires at least 3 signatures out of 6.

### What's the role of the Operations Multisig?

Adding / removing pools; changing pool weights (rewards); changing the $SUSHI block reward; approving transactions coming out the growth fund; overall changes to the smart contracts.

### What's the role of the Treasury Multisig?

Approving transactions coming out of the devfund.

### How many signers are needed?

3 for Ops, 3 for Treasury

xSUSHI (staked $SUSHI): the number of staked $SUSHI (it will change over time as your $SUSHI balance grows) = your SUSHIPOWAH
